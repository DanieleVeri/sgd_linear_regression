## Stochastic gradient descent for linear regression

By Luca Serfilippi and Daniele Ver√¨

### How to launch
- `python linear_regression.py` to run linear regression on the `ocean.csv` dataset, where there is a linear relationship between the water temperature and the water salinity.

- `python multivariate_regression.py` to run the multivariate case on the `energy.csv` dataset, where there is a linear relationship between house attributes (surface, wall area, etc.) and the heating load.
